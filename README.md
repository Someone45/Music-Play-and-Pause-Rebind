# Music-Play-and-Pause-Rebind
You can rebind your play or pause key to a new key or combination of keys on keyboards that do not have the play/pause key.

## Modules Needed:
```
pip install keyboard
```


To change the key being binded, replace "EnterKeyCombinationHere" with the combination of keys necessary.
